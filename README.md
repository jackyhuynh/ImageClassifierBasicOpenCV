# Python_Image_Classifier_using_OpenCV


## Introduction
This is a serial of Self-Driving Car technology (the image classifier using Open CV). This respo include small applications for image identifier, sorting, resize, modify, store and step by step to build the whole image classifier that can apply to many image classifier.

## Technology
- Python 
- Object Oriented Design
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Visualization
- Localization
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Open CV

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- Jupyter Notebook: If you want just test the code, simply go to google and search for jupiter notebook or another Python online IDE. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 
- Anacoda Navigator: Install Anaconda Navigator if you want to develop data sciences using python or R. Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface included in Anaconda that allows you to launch applications and easily manage conda packages, environments and channels without the need to use command line commands. 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development enviroment running

* [Install Anacoda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/install/#:~:text=Installing%20Navigator%20Navigator%20is%20automatically%20installed%20when%20you,install%20anaconda-navigator.%20To%20start%20Navigator,%20see%20Getting%20Started.) - If you haven't downloaded and installed Anacoda Navigator yet, here's how to get started.
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try) - Click here to go to the online free Jupiter Notebook.


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:
- There is no download IDE need, all you need is download all the src to your machine and run it.
- Using Jupiter Notebook
- Navigate to the file .ipynb
- hit:

```
Ctrl + Enter
```

## Deployment

Route PLanner class can be deploy and ready to work with any sensor, or moving robotic prediction. Idea for localization and/or GPS application. This is actually what we use for driving direction everyday. According to Sebastian, this technology have been around for 15 years, and still helping human each day.
Please refer to my notebook for a better understanding of implementation.
